100 Days of Python & Data Science

This repository contains my daily learning progress as part of my 100 Days of Python & Data Science journey.

I am focusing on building strong fundamentals by learning concepts step by step and practicing them with simple Python programs.

📅 Day 2: Python Variables

Learned how variables are used to store data in Python

Understood updating variable values

Practiced with a basic example using name, age, and course

📅 Day 3: Python Data Types

Explored different Python data types:

Numeric

Boolean

Text

Sequence

Mapping

Set

Binary

Understood how Python categorizes and handles different kinds of data

🎯 Goal

To stay consistent, strengthen my basics, and gradually move towards Data Science and Machine Learning.
